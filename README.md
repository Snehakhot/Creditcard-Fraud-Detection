# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

## Purpose
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Setup Instructions
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download Dataset**: Obtain the 'creditcard.csv' dataset.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn
   - imbalanced-learn

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the provided Python script 'credit_card_fraud_detection.py' to train and evaluate the model.

## Project Structure
- `credit_card_fraud_detection.py`: Main Python script for model building and evaluation.
- `creditcard.csv`: Dataset containing credit card transactions.
- `credit_card_fraud_detection_model.pkl`: Saved trained model.
